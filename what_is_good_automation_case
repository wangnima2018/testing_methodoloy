```
what's a good automated testcase?

A1: easy to check the log and debug when thereâ€™s a failure
A2: easy for others to maintain and understand, with clear logs
A3: deterministic (not flaky), hermetic server. 
A4: time to develop the new testcase based on existing one? 
A5: one to one mapping between testplan to testcase (ex: pass/fail criteria)
A6: make sure the testcase can be clean up properly

```
