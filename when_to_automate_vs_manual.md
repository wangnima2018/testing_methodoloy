When should you use automation, when to use manual testing?

Automation
advantage of automation:
1 it helps to save time
2 when resource is limited
3 when you want to eliminate human errors

disadvantage of automation:
1 might result in higher costs for testing tools
2 doesn't make sense for for random testing (maybe this can work with ML)
An automated test does what you tell it to do. 
And it will stick to it no matter what. 
There is no way to find out errors or bugs that are not defined by your testing scenario.
3 Automated Test are not able see like humans (yet)

When to use automation:
1 Time consuming tasks
2 Repetitive tasks
3 functional testing
4 performance or loading testing
5 advanced GUI testing 
For advanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing, 
automating these can save a lot of time. 
Automated GUI tests detect and track behavior differences between different web browsers, 
operating systems, devices, etc.


Manual testing:
Automation is simply not possible without a strong foundation built on initial manual testing. 
Manual testing requires more time & effort initially, but it can definitely help pay off over time.

This provides the opportunity to uncover bugs or display issues that automated tests simply canâ€™t filter and catch.
