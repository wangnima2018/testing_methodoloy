When should you use automation, when to use manual testing?

Automation
advantage of automation:
1 it helps to save time
2 when resource is limited
3 when you want to eliminate human errors

disadvantage of automation:
1 might result in higher costs for testing tools
2 doesn't make sense for for random testing (maybe this can work with ML)
An automated test does what you tell it to do. 
And it will stick to it no matter what. 
There is no way to find out errors or bugs that are not defined by your testing scenario.
3 Automated Test are not able see like humans (yet)

When to use automation:
1 Time consuming tasks
2 Repetitive tasks
3 functional testing
4 performance or loading testing
5 advanced GUI testing 
For advanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing, 
automating these can save a lot of time. 
Automated GUI tests detect and track behavior differences between different web browsers, 
operating systems, devices, etc.


Manual testing:
Automation is simply not possible without a strong foundation built on initial manual testing. 
Manual testing requires more time & effort initially, but it can definitely help pay off over time.

This provides the opportunity to uncover bugs or display issues that automated tests simply can’t filter and catch.

First need basic manual testing to understand what's automatable and what's not.
Great For After Small Updates
1 Allows For Accurate Setup Of Automated Testing
Manual testing allows and ensures the proper setup of automation testing.
You can’t automate until you know what kinds of things you will be regularly looking for within your applications or software.
2 No Advanced Programming Needed
3 Ensures that the Visual Presentation Is As Expected.
4 This especially relates to tests that focus on user interfaces and usability. 
(Great For After Small Updates)


Disadvantage of manual testing: 
1 Human Error Is Present 
2 More Time & More People Are Needed
3 If not properly reported the feedback is invaluable
4 If it's a exploratory testing, need to carefully document the steps. Otherwise, hard to repro the bug.



Note:
When doing manual testing, (especially like explotary testing) it might be a little bit hard to record all the steps.
